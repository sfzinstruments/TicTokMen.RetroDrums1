# Details

These are samples of old drum machines I've collected over the years.
Not all recordings were done in house (but all are free use licenses).

The sample set consists of several drum machines (listed below).
Each drum machines sounds are spread out over each octave from C1 to C7.
There are, in some cases, sounds from some machines that have been grouped
with others. This is because that machine had more then 12 sounds.
But, the basic layout is the same on each.

C = Bass Drum
C# = Closed Hi-hat
D = Snare
D# = Open Hi-hat
E = Rimshot
F = Low Tom
F# = Ride
G = Mid or High Tom
G# = Crash
A = High Tom or various
A# = Random Sound
B = Handclap
